A basic algorithmic stock trading bot

## My Approach

The end goal is to have a bot that has access to all publicly traded companies. There will be a list of critieria that make a company 
desirable to trade, and these companies will be selected by the bot. Once a company is selected, the bot will analyze historical trends, and 
will look to enter a position, and will begin trading the stock, according to some strategy.

Right now, I will act as though we have completed the first step, that being selecting a company to trade. This way, I can focus on processing and preparing
the historical stock data to be ingested by the bot, as well as beginning actual work on the bot.
